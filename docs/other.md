#### Kibana Demo Template (optional)

To get you up and running quickly, a dashboard template for Kibana is available in the file `firestic_kibana.json` located in the `prep_files` directory. It's pretty basic and I suspect you'll want to extend this further...or step past Kibana altogether and build your own uber-cool home-grown dashboard website to present the data.

#### Q: FireStic? Really? Where did you get that stupid name?

**A:** Because it indexes **FIRE**eye alerts into ela**STIC**search...and I'm not overly creative.
